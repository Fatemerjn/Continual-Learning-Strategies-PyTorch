# Continual-Learning-Strategies-PyTorch
This repository contains a PyTorch-based project for exploring and implementing various continual learning (CL) strategies to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. It includes implementations for Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) and conceptual stubs for PackNet and Gradient Episodic Memory (GEM), all evaluated on the Split CIFAR-100 dataset.
